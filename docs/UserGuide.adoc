== Introduction

Personal Finance Tracker is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for expense tracking*. More importantly, Personal Finance Tracker is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Whether if you are an expert user or a non tech savvy user, we have commands that cater towards you guys!Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
