By: `CS2103-AY1819S2-W15-2`      Since: `Feb 2019`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle.adoc#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S2-W15-2/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S2-W15-2/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteExpense.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExpenseListPanel`, `BudgetListPanel`, `DebtListPanel`, `RecurringListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FinanceTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a expense).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteexpense 1` Command
image::DeleteExpenseSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// tag::design-model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Finance Tracker data.
* exposes unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>`, `ObservableList<Recurring>`, `ObservableList<Debt>`, `ObservableList<Budget>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
// end::design-model[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram1.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Finance Tracker data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFinanceTracker`.
It extends `FinanceTracker` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `financeTrackerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFinanceTracker#commit()` -- Saves the current finance tracker state in its history.
* `VersionedFinanceTracker#undo()` -- Restores the previous finance tracker state from its history.
* `VersionedFinanceTracker#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone finance tracker state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, `Model#undoFinanceTracker()` and `Model#redoFinanceTracker()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFinanceTracker` will be initialized with the initial finance tracker state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `deleteexpense 5` command to delete the 5th expense in the finance tracker. The `deletexpense` command calls `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, causing the modified state of the finance tracker after the `deleteexpense 5` command executes to be saved in the `financeTrackerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted finance tracker state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `addexpense n/BKT ...` to add a new expense. The `addexpense` command also calls `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, causing another modified finance tracker state to be saved into the `financeTrackerStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFinanaceTracker()`, so the finance tracker state will not be saved into the `financeTrackerStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFinanceTracker()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous finance tracker state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial finance tracker state, then there are no previous finance tracker states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFinanceTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoFinanceTracker()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the finance tracker to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `financeTrackerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest finance tracker state, then there are no undone finance tracker states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFinanceTracker()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listexpense v/all`. Commands that do not modify the finance tracker, such as `listexpense`, will usually not call `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`, `Model#undoFInanceTracker()` or `Model#redoFinanceTracker()`. Thus, the `financeTrackerStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clearexpense`, which calls `Model#commitFinanceTracker()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `financeTrackerStateList`, all finance tracker states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `addexpense n/BKT ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire finance tracker.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteexpense`, just save the expense being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of finance tracker states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedFinanceTracker`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::listingfeature[]
=== Listing Feature

This feature allows users to filter out specific items based on the view specified. Only expenses that are under those views will be shown on the respective list panels.

Listing feature consists of `listexpense`, `listrecurring` and `listdebt`.

This implementation is under Logic and Model components.

==== Current implementation

Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of an example usage scenario for `listexpense`. The other list commands have similar implementations.

image::ListExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

1. User enters command `listexpense v/food`. The command is received by `FinanceTrackerParser`, which then creates a `ListExpenseCommandParser` object. The created object then calls `ListExpenseCommandParser#parse("v/food")` method.

2. `ListExpenseCommandParser#parse("v/food")` method calls the `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the input `v/food` and stores it in an `ArgumentMultiMap` object.

3. `ListExpenseCommandParse#parse("v/food")` method then calls `ParserUtil#parseView(argMultiMap#getValue(PREFIX_VIEW)#get())` and gets a `View` object in return.

4.  After that, a  `ListExpenseCommand` object is created with the `View` object as parameter and return to `LogicManager`.

5. `LogicManager` then calls `ListExpenseCommand#execute()`, which calls `Model#updateFilteredExpense(predicate)`, where predicate is obtained from calling the `ListExpenseCommand#getPredicate(view)`. It then updates the filter of the filtered expense list and it now contains the new set of expenses that are filtered by the predicate.

6. Finally, the expense list panel will show the new set of expenses. A `CommandResult` is then created and returned to `LogicManager`.

==== Design Consideration

This feature can be implemented in different ways in terms of how the specified expenses are filtered out. The alternative ways of implementation are shown below.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Go through all expenses in the `FinanceTracker` and filter out those that are under the specified view.
** Pros: Easy to implement. The original architecture is preserved.
** Cons: Time-consuming. Large number of expenses in FinanceTracker will take longer time to filter.

* Alternative 2: Store expenses in separate files based on different views. Only check files under the specified view when filtering.
** Pros: More efficient. Will not go through every single expense.
** Cons: Will need to alter the original architecture. More storage space will be needed.

// end::listingfeature[]

// tag::recurringfeature[]
=== Recurring Feature

The Recurring feature consists of `addrecurring`, `editrecurring`, `listrecurring`, `deleterecurring` `clearrecurring`, and `convertrecurring`. +

Recurring expenses are expenses that are periodic and have a fixed frequency and a defined number of occurrences. Examples of these recurring expenses are bills or subscription fees. +

This feature allows users to add recurring expenses to the finance tracker and be able to constantly keep track of them. This is done by calling `Logic#execute` which creates an `AddRecurringCommand`. This command then calls `Model#addRecurring`, adding the specified recurring into the recurring list. +

This feature also simplifies the deletion and editing of these recurring expenses, and they work in a similar manner.

==== Convert Recurring To Expense Feature

The purpose of this feature is to provide the convenience for users by adding outstanding expenses from all their recurring expenses into the expense list. After adding recurring expenses into the Finance Tracker, the user can call `convertrecurring` to make the conversion.

===== Current Implementation

Below is a step-by=step explanation of an example usage scenario for `convertrecurring`.

1. User enters the command `convertrecurring`, to add outstanding expenses from all their recurring expenses into the expense list. This command is executed by `LogicManager`, which calls `FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand("convertrecurring")`. This creates a `ConvertRecurringToExpenseCommand` object and returned to the `LogicManager`.

2. The `LogicManager` calls `ConvertRecurringToExpenseCommand#execute`, which will call Model#getFilteredRecurringList() to retrieve the list of recurrings in the financetracker.

3. The programme then iterates through the recurring list, and for each recurring, checks the recurring's `lastConvertedDate`, which is the last time the recurring has gone through a `convertrecurring` check.

4. If the recurring's `lastConvertedDate` is before the current date, this recurring will have to be checked again for outstanding expenses that can potentially be added.

5. The programme then calls Recurring#getRecurringListofExpenses to retrieve the list of expenses that are supposed to be added by this recurring, and iterates through this expense list.

6. If the expense's date is before or equals to the current date, and after the `lastConvertedDate`, this recurring expense will have to be converted into an expense and added into the FinanceTracker. This is done by calling Model#addExpense(recurringListOfExpenses.get(j)).

7. This is done for each expense of the recurring. After the iteration, the recurring's `lastConvertedDate` is set to the current date.

8. This is done for each recurring in the list.

=== Delete and Edit Recurring deletes the associated Expense (coming in v1.4)

This is still a work in progress. +

The purpose of this feature is to delete or edit expenses already added by a recurring that the user wishes to delete or edit.

// end::recurringfeature[]

// tag::debt[]
=== Debt Feature

The Debt feature consists of `adddebt`, `editdebt`, `listdebt`, `deletedebt`, `cleardebt` and `paydebt`. +

This feature allows users to add debts to the finance tracker and be able to constantly keep track of them. This is done by calling `Logic#execute` which creates an `AddDebtCommand`. This command then calls `Model#addDebt`, adding the specified debt into the debt list. +

Editing, deleting and clearing of debts work in a similar manner.

==== Pay Debt Feature

The purpose of this feature is to provide the convenience for users to indicate that they have paid off a particular debt and seamlessly convert that into an expense. +

===== Current Implementation

Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of an example usage scenario for `paydebt`.

image::PayDebtSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

1. User enters the command `paydebt 1`, to convert the first listed debt on the user interface into an expense. This command is executed by `LogicManager`, which calls `FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand("paydebt 1")`. This creates a new `PayDebtCommandParser` object which will help parse the input by the user.

2. The newly created object calls `parse("1")` which in turns calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize("1", "d/")` to split the arguments into its preamble(the index) and the date(if inputted by the user). This returns an `argMultiMap` containing the split input.

3. The `PayDebtCommandParser` object then calls `ParserUtil#parseIndex(argMultiMap.getPreamble())` and `ParserUtil#parseDate(argMultiMap.getValue("d/").get())` to parse the arguments into the index and date into its correct form respectively. If the user does not input a date, the program will use the local date on the system's clock. A `PayDebtCommand` object containing the index and date is then created and returned to the `LogicManager`.

4. The `LogicManager` calls `PayDebtCommand#execute()`, which will call `Model#getFilteredDebtList()` to retrieve the list of debts stored in the finance tracker. The method `get(index)` is then called to retrieve the `debt` the user was intending to convert.

5. An expense is then created by retrieving out the following relevant information from the `debt` entry: +

* `Person Owed`
* `Amount`
* `Category`
* `Remarks`

6. The programme then take this information and creates a new Expense `convertedExpense` with the following fields: +

* `Name` : Paid Debt to `Person Owed`
* `Amount` : Same amount will be used
* `Category` : Same category will be used
* `Date` : Based on user's input on when the debt is paid, else the program will use the local date in the system's clock
* `Remarks` : Same remarks will be used

7. `Model#deleteDebt(debt)` and `Model#addExpense(convertedExpense)` are then called to delete the targeted `debt` from the debt list and add the `convertedExpense` into the expense list accordingly.

8. The command result is then returned to the `LogicManager` which then returns it to the `UI` where the changes are then reflected on the user interface.

==== Debt Notifications (Coming in v2.0)

This is still a work in progress. +

The purpose of this feature is to alert users when the deadline for their debts is approaching. These alerts come in the form of either a pop-up notification or an email alert. +

It is up to the user on when they would like to receive this notification. Currently, there are plans to implement the following options: +

* `1 month` before debt deadline
* `1 week` before debt deadline
* `3 days` before debt deadline
* `1 day` before debt deadline

===== Future Implementation

Once the `duration` option is set, each time the main application loads, the programme will go through every debt in `Model#getFilteredDebtList()`, deduct `duration` from each `Debt#getDeadline()` to get its `notificationDate` and add them to a new list `notificationDates`. +

Each `notificationDate` is then checked against `LocalDate#now()`. If `notificationDate` is before or equals to `LocalDate#now`, they are then added to a new list `notificationsToBeAlerted`. +

Every item in `notificationsToBeAlerted` is then printed on an alert box, reminding the user of the upcoming deadlines for their debts.
// end::debt[]

// tag::stats[]
=== Statistics Feature

This feature allows users to calculate various statistics for the entries in their Financial Tracker. The feature will read the expenses, debts and budgets and generate various metrics to display.

The Statistic feature consists of `stats`, `statstrend` and `statscompare`

This implementation is under Logic and Model components.

==== `stats`

===== Current implementation

Below is the UML sequence diagram and a step-by-step explanation of an example usage scenario for `stats`.

(UML here)

1. User enters command `stats c/food`. The command is received by `FinanceTrackerParser`, which then creates a `StatsCommandParser` object. The created object then calls `StatsCommandParser.parse("v/food")` method.

2. `StatsCommandParser.parse("v/food")` method calls the `ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize()` to tokenize the input `v/food` and stores it in an `ArgumentMultiMap` object.

3. `StatsCommandParse.parse("v/food")` method then calls `ParserUtil.parseCategory(argMultiMap.getCategory(PREFIX_Category).get())` and gets a `Category` object in return.

4. `StatsCommandParser` will then create a relevant `Statistic` object.

5.  After that, a `StatsCommand` object is created with the `Statistic` object as parameter and return to `LogicManager`.

6. `LogicManager` then calls `StatsCommand.execute()`, which calls `Model.getStatistics(Statistics)` using the `Statistic` object created in step 3

7. `Model.getStatistics(Statistics)` will call `Statistics.calculate` which will generate the appropriate results

8.  The result will be shown on the UI

===== Design Consideration

Work in Progress
// end::stats[]
// tag::budget[]
=== Budget feature

This feature allows users to set budgets for different categories so they can limit the amount spent for each category.

It stores all budgets added by the user and keeps track of the expenses added within the user-specified time frame.

The implementation of the budget feature is under the Logic and Model components.

==== Current implementation

===== Adding a budget:
User enters the command word `addbudget`, followed by the category for which they want to set the budget for, the amount they want to limit themselves to for that category and specifies the start and end date for that budget.

===== Editing an existing budget:
User enters the command word `editbudget`, followed by the category for which they want to edit the budget of and the relevant parameters of which they wish to edit the values of.

===== Deleting an existing budget:
User enters the command word `deletebudget`, followed by the category for which they wish to delete the budget for.

For all three actions, the user command gets parsed by the respective parsers: `AddBudgetCommandParser`, `EditBudgetCommandParser` and `DeleteBudgetCommandParser`, which handle the execution of the commands.

Below is the UML sequence diagram of a scenario for the `addbudget` command.

image::AddBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Updating of budgets:
* When a new budget is added, the model checks the expense list for any expenses of that category which fall within the time frame of the added budget
and sets the `totalSpent` and `percentage` variables of the Budget object accordingly.
* When an existing budget is edited, the model updates the `percentage` variable of the Budget object.
* For every expense the user enters, the model will check if there exists a budget for the category of the added expense
and if the date of the expense is within the time frame of the budget.
If the added expense is during the time of the budget, the totalSpent variable in the Budget object with that specific category will be updated.
* The total amount spent for each budget category, along with the percentage of the total budgeted amount, will be displayed to the user so that the user can know how much has been spent so far and can better plan their future expenses so as not to exceed their budget.

==== Future Enhancements
The Budget class has a boolean method `overlaps(Budget other)` which returns true if two budgets of the same category have overlapping time frames.
This method was included with the idea of allowing the user to add multiple budgets for the same category but for different time frames.

Another possible enhancement would be to allow the user to set a recurring budget.
For example, if a user wants to limit their daily spending to $20, maybe an `addrecurringbudget c/food $/20 f/d` command, similar to the recurring expense command, could be implemented so that the user does not have to add a budget everyday.

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Finance Tracker depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components.

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of expenses, debts and bills/subscriptions
* wants to keep track of how much is being spent
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: manage finances faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
